## Description

Say you have an array `prices` for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

//Check the original version of this solution at No.121 and the link at Further part to better understand this
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices.length == 0 ) return 0;
        int dp_i_0 = 0, dp_i_1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int temp = dp_i_0;
            dp_i_0 = Math.max(dp_i_0, dp_i_1 + prices[i]);
            dp_i_1 = Math.max(dp_i_1, temp - prices[i]);
        }
        return dp_i_0;
    }
}
