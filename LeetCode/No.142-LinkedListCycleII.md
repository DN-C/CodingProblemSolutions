## Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](../Resources/Images/No.142-LinkedListCycleII/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](../Resources/Images/No.142-LinkedListCycleII/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](../Resources/Images/No.142-LinkedListCycleII/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Thinking

Two pointers. One walks step at a time, the other walks two steps at a time. When they meet, it means there is a cycle in the linked list. Let anyone of them point to head, then both of two walk one step at a time. When they meet again, the place they meet is what we want.

            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if(fast == slow) {
                fast = head;
                while(fast != slow) {
                    fast = fast.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
