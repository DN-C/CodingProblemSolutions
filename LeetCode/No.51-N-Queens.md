Given an integer *n*, return all distinct solutions to the *n*-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the *n*-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
