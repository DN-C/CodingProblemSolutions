# Coding Problem Solutions
## Descriptions

A place storing all my thinking &amp; solutions about coding problems.



## Notice

1. This project is not friendly to people who don't know Chinese because there are many Chinese website links and some Chinese words inside. What's more my English is not well so I may not be able to describe what I think in English properly. 

2. But why I choose writing all this stuff in English? You know, practice makes perfect. Maybe one day I can delete this notice section with confidence.
3. If you see I say credit to @someone, you can find the reference in the Further part.
